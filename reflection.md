Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment. 

What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

Testing and debugging were more complex than I thought. Making sure all methods worked correctly required very careful work and patience. I met issues with the inventory management logic in the ResaleShop class, like computers were not being added or removed correctly. Plus, translating procedural logic into an object-oriented design is challenging for me. As a beginner in python, I would do some extra coding practice to get familiar with these contents and try my best to learn more.
I would suggest to plan ahead and do the assignments early since they does require some time.
